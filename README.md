Name
What I'm Eating Today: Your Best Diet Recommendation Partner

Background
The theme of our group is a small program of diet recommendation. Most of the young people nowadays have Choice Phobia, they will struggle with what to eat every day, and people are also very concerned about the health issues in their diet, they will care more about the nutrient content or calorie level of food, so our group decided to make a diet recommendation app.

At present, there are already software on the market that has the function of recommending frequently ordered dishes for restaurants and takeaways, such as Dianping and Meituan. People have also worked out some ways to randomly decide what to eat for the next meal, such as using a pick box app or making their own carousel, but each app has a single function, and in our research, there is no app that has both a pick box and food recommendation function. Therefore, in order to facilitate the use of the user, we decided to develop such a small program, in the collection of the above-mentioned functions at the same time, the small program also has a light and simple, easy to use features, more users can enjoy a convenient recommendation service at anytime, anywhere.
